Building Compelling Data Stories in Tableau: From Numbers to Narrative
This repository contains materials for a workshop on building compelling data stories in Tableau. The workshop focuses on transforming raw data into a powerful narrative that informs and educates. 

Introduction
In today's data-driven world, being able to tell a story with data is an essential skill for anyone working with information. In this workshop, we will explore how to create a compelling data story in Tableau, from selecting the right data to crafting a narrative that engages your audience. By the end of this workshop, you will have a deeper understanding of how to transform raw data into a powerful story.

Synopsis
The journey from Numbers to Narrative begins with understanding your data. Participants will use Chicago's hate crime data to build a compelling narrative of the rise and cause of hate crimes through data visualization. The workshop will discuss the importance of identifying your audience, defining your key message, and structuring your story for maximum impact.

Throughout the workshop, participants will be using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to bring their data to life. They will learn how to use Tableau to create interactive dashboards, build dynamic visualizations, and explore their data in new and exciting ways.

As part of the workshop, participants will also be introduced to Tableau's Makeover Monday challenge, a weekly event where data analysts around the world come together to transform a static data visualization into a more compelling and effective one.
